Already created a  CourseMode
	id, name, code

Create series of web pages
	/Course => list of courses
	/Course/1	=> display course with id = 1

Why? How we can create objects
introduce / learn LINQ simple example
reinforces working with Controller/View
introduces Model interaction
Steps
	-created mode
	-created controller
	-in Controller: create a list of Courses
	as field  
	overview send this list of courses as model to View	2) in view, reference this course model. using a table
	display the course details for index

	3) for Details, get a Course by id => display it
	  as a Model to view
	4) add method Program(string,string) get a Course object by code and/or name
		
	To-Do
	



List<DataType> name = new List<Dataype>([starting capacity]);

List<DataType> name = new List<DataType>(){add elements}
	//empty:no Items
	//capacity of 4
	// cap increases by x2 (doubles)

List<int>
List<string>
List<float>



access a specific Item
name[index]


L anguage
INtegrated
Query


lambda epression
	arrow function
		method w/o a name

	methodName(params){ return value}
	
	params => value

	predicate  lambda expression/arrow function
		that returns a Boolean value




In the Details view
	Display the details of the one course
	-remember to model
	- @ is your friend




create the method Program
	-add a View
	-method accepts 2 string arguments
